# Security Policy

No technology is perfect, and Teapot believes that working with skilled security researchers across the globe is crucial in identifying weaknesses in any technology. If you believe you've found a security issue in Teapot, we encourage you to notify us. We welcome working with you to resolve the issue promptly. Thank you for keeping Teapot and its users safe!

## Disclosure Policy

Let us know as soon as possible upon discovery of a potential security issue, and we'll make every effort to quickly resolve the issue. Please bear in mind we're a project run entirely by volunteers in our spare time.

Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our service. Only interact with accounts you own or with our explicit permission.

See the "Security" section of our README for instructions on how to report a security vulnerability.

If it's a straightforward fix: please submit a pull request on GitHub.

We will respond to and fix reported, reproducible security vulnerabilities as soon as possible. A gentle reminder that we are a volunteer-run project, so please give us a reasonable amount of time to resolve the issue before any disclosure to the public or a third-party.
